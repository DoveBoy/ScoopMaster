For each module found, it lists all the functions that are exported by that module, and which of those functions are actually being called by other modules. Another view displays the minimum set of required files, along with detailed information about each file including a full path to the file, base address, version numbers, machine type, debug information, and more. Dependency Walker is also very useful for troubleshooting system errors related to loading and executing modules. Dependency Walker detects many common application problems such as missing modules, invalid modules, import/export mismatches, circular dependency errors, mismatched machine types of modules, and module initialization failures. Dependency Walker runs on Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7, and 8. It can process any 32-bit or 64-bit Windows module, including ones designed for Windows CE. It can be run as graphical application or as a console application. Dependency Walker handles all types of module dependencies, including implicit, explicit (dynamic / runtime), forwarded, delay-loaded, and injected. A detailed help is included. Dependency Walker is completely free to use. However, you may not profit from the distribution of it, nor may you bundle it with another product."

When this function is called, the debugger will stop in the beginning of this function. For example: If you want to break each time that a message box is going to be displayed, simply put breakpoints on the memory addresses of message-box functions: MessageBoxA, MessageBoxExA, and MessageBoxIndirectA (or MessageBoxW, MessageBoxExW, and MessageBoxIndirectW in unicode based applications) When one of the message-box functions is called, your debugger should break in the entry point of that function, and then you can look at call stack and go backward into the code that initiated this API call."

The bullets beside the items of unordered lists are replaced by ASCII characters according to your selection. * Definition lists are formatted by adding spaces in the left side of the definition lines. * Optionally, centered and right-aligned paragraphs are formatted accordingly by adding space characters in the left side of the lines. * Optionally, HTMLAsText allows you to add a line under each heading (<h1> - <h6> tags) * Simple tables can be delimited by spaces, tab characters, commas, or CRLF. * Preformatted text blocks (<pre> tag) are copied ""as is"", without formatting the text. * You can convert multiple HTML files in the same folder at once, by using wildcard.

The makers have recently released the latest version, V 0.2.1; and so far, Nintendo DS on PC fans are pleased with the remarkable graphics and improving sounds. NeonDS does not require a high end PC for functioning well. Pentium 4 processor, 512 GB to 1 GB RAM and 128 MB video support are enough to run the program at normal playable speeds. It works on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 OS.  Since the first public version (V 0.0.2) was released in 2008, the emulator has exhibited remarkable optimization. Even if the computer does not have a Dual-Core processor, the emulator can run at an impressive 50 to 60 frames per second (FPS). It even has an exploit system called the OpenGL 2.0. This allows the user to take screen shots of the game! Development of the software took a giant leap in Version 0.2.0. Here, the makers have finally completed its new 3 dimensional display engine, which enables crisper graphics and the video capturing feature. Many full 3D games became playable, and many bugs were fixed. The NDS firmware settings were also updated. As for the tactile input on the DS touch-screen, later versions of the NeonDS have been equipped a virtual interface. The window of the program has two screens, like the real NDS. The touch screen works by pressing and dragging with the mouse pointer. The basic directional controls, A-B buttons etc, are operated by the keyboard. The corresponding keyboards buttons are fully customizable."

Optionally, you can also close one or more opened files, or close the process that opened these files. This utility is especially useful if you try to delete/move/open a file and you get one of the following error messages: * Cannot delete [filename]: There has been a sharing violation. The source or destination file may be in use. * Cannot delete [filename]: It is being used by another person or program. Close any programs that might be using the file and try again. When you get one of these error messages, OpenedFilesView will show you which process lock your file. Closing the right process will solve this problem. optionally, you can also release the file by closing the handle from OpenedFilesView utility."

But what about viewing some historical images from a few days ago, or watching the animation of the images from the last few hours ?? Some Web sites provides limited options to do that, but most Web sites only allows you to watch the latest image. This utility allows you to automatically download an image file in every few seconds or minutes (according to your selection), and save it to your local drive. After collecting a fair amount of downloaded images in your local drive, you can easily create beautiful animation from the downloaded images or simply watch the historical images on your local download folder. You can also use this utility to frequently download non-image files, and store them on your local drive, so we'll always have in your computer the latest file from the remote Web site. This utility is especially useful for live cams Web sites, weather radar images, and satellite images."

You can view the TCP/IP conversations in Ascii mode (for text-based protocols, like HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and FTP.) or as hex dump. (for non-text base protocols, like DNS) SmartSniff provides 2 methods for capturing TCP/IP packets : * Raw Sockets (Only for Windows 2000/XP or greater): Allows you to capture TCP/IP packets on your network without installing a capture driver. This method has some limitations and problems. * WinPcap Capture Driver: Allows you to capture TCP/IP packets on all Windows operating systems. (Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003) In order to use it, you have to download and install WinPcap Capture Driver from this Web site. (WinPcap is a free open-source capture driver.) This method is generally the preferred way to capture TCP/IP packets with SmartSniff, and it works better than the Raw Sockets method."
